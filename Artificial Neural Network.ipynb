Sometimes in our dataset, certain variables have very high values while certain variables have very low values. So there is a chance that during model creation, the variables having extremely high-value dominate variables having extremely low value. Because of this, there is a possibility that those variables with the low value might be neglected by our model, and hence feature scaling is necessary.\n",

While the testing dataset is something on which our model is going to be evaluated. If we perform feature scaling before the train-test split then it will cause information leakage on testing datasets which neglects the purpose of having a testing dataset and hence we should always perform feature scaling after the train-test split.\n",
